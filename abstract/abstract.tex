\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis discusses two major computational projects in conformal field theory
(CFT) and the interpretation of their results. The first, concerning the 
Virasoro Conformal Blocks of 2-dimensional CFT, uses dynamic programming and 
extreme precision arithmetic to prove that information is not lost after it 
falls into a black hole in 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The second, a
3-dimensional realization of a generic CFT technique called conformal 
truncation, uses a truncated basis of operators to naturally map CFT questions 
to finite-dimensional linear algebra problems, then solves them with dynamic
programming and large matrix methods. To demonstrate the correctness of the 
program, we use it to show the closure of the mass gap in the 3D Ising model.
