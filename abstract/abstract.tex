\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis discusses two major computational projects in conformal field theory
(CFT) and the interpretation of their results. The first, concerning the 
Virasoro Conformal Blocks of 2-dimensional CFT, uses dynamic programming and 
extreme precision arithmetic to prove that information is not lost after it 
falls into a black hole in 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The second,
a generic CFT technique, uses basis truncation to naturally map CFT questions to
finite-dimensional linear algebra problems, then solves them with dynamic
programming and large matrix methods to show the closure of the mass gap in the
3D Ising model and closely reproduce its spectral densities.
