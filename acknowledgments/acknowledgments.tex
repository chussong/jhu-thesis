\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank the overwhelming chaos of human society which has afforded
me the opportunity to study physics to this extent. Among the many untaken 
paths and the many more which were never encountered, there are surely some
which would have proven equally satisfactory, but this one has been decidedly
preferable to the great majority of imaginable alternatives.

Thank you, chaos.
